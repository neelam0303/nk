                My Dearest Love,
            </p>
            <p>
            In that little moment, when we first met,<br>
            Your hand wrote "I love you", a morning dew so wet. <br>
            Since then, happiness found its way, <br>
            From a bit unsure, to love, we sway. <br>

            <br>
            Your smile, your words, your hair so fine, <br>
            The mirror of my heart, you're the most divine.<br>
            In every grin of yours, my heart takes flight,<br>
            Without you, my world's incomplete, in the dark night.<br>

           <br>
            Lost in your talks, every moment with you,<br>
            Your smile brings joy, it's undeniably true.<br>
            In your love, I'll fulfill every desire,<br>
            You're my path of love, my constant fire.<br>

            <br>
            Your smile, your words, your hair so fine,<br>
            The mirror of my heart, you're the most divine.<br>
            In every grin of yours, my heart takes flight,<br>
            Without you, my world's incomplete, in the dark night.<br>

           <br> 
            Nothing without you, you're my guiding light,<br>
            Nothing but you, by my side, so right.<br>
            Without you, my life's an incomplete story,<br>
            You're my love, my dream, my ultimate glory.<br>

            <br>
            Your smile, your words, your hair so fine,<br>
            The mirror of my heart, you're the most divine.<br>
            In every grin of yours, my heart takes flight,<br>
            Without you, my world's incomplete, in the dark night.<br>
